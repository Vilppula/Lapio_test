FIRST LINE EDITED !!! Before text editors existed, computer text was punched into cards with keypunch machines. 
Physical boxes of these thin cardboard cards were then inserted into a card-reader. 
Magnetic tape and disk "card-image" files created from such card decks often had no line-separation 
characters at all, and assumed fixed-length 80-character records. An alternative to cards was punched paper tape. 
LAST LINE CHANGED !!! It could be created by some teleprinters, which used special characters to indicate ends of records.
